Ghost in the Machine:
Things Beep and Boop say

------------------------
OPENING 
------------------------

[Beep]: The ghosts are revolting and making a mess! We have to help the customers!
[Boop]: ...Do we have to?
[Beep]: Mr. Watts left the Power Convenience Store to us! We can't just let the customers see the store as it is.
[Boop]: Beep left... Well I guess if the ghosts are messing around there will be floors to clean. Back to work, all the time. 

------------------------
Random things they can say between levels 
------------------------

[Boop]: I guess we should be glad the ghosts are knocking stuff off the shelves. It's not like we can reach them ourselves.
[Beep]: I wish they'd at least power the lights. It's so depressing.
[Boop]: I'd rahter they just go obediently back to powering our batteries. 


------------------------

Mr. Watts does wattever he wants.

------------------------

The Ghost Party Squad hosts parties every 1024 hours. This one got a little out of hand.

------------------------

[Beep]: You've got to do more than work! You've got to put time into it!
[Boop]: But if you put too much time into it you won't have any power!

------------------------

[Beep]: Why is my light so much shorter than yours?
[Boop]: I guess you could say you have a power shortage.

------------------------

[Beep]: The ghosts have barricaded themselves behind a wall of fire! They still refurse to work. 
[Boop]: I propose we leave buggy ghsots behind the firewall.

------------------------

Ghosts are used to power everything in the Power Convenience Store, including its two employees, Beep and Boop.
