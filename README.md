# LD39
Ghost in the Machine is a 2D top-down cooperative game. It was made for the Ludum Dare 39 game jam by Matt Hansen (art), Alexis Korb (programming), Brian MacIntosh (programming), Minnie Wu (level design, additional art), and Justin Britch (sound design). The theme for the game jam was "Running out of Power".

As this game was made largely from scratch in 48 hours, it probably contains numerous hacks and bad code.
